Simple Azure - VNet-2-VNet Connection - PowerShell Script
=========================================================

            

The purpose of this script is to create two Azure Virtual Networks in different Azure regions and then make connectivity between them. PowerShell script will create Virtual Networks, Define Virtual Gateways, Virtual Networks Connections and connectivity
 between them. Just define your parameters in order to execute script. My location is New Zealand so in region parameters you will see Australia since its close to us.


 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
